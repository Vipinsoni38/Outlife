#problems which are being faced by the domestic and foreign tourists in Rajasthan

1) Poor advertisement for the publicity of tourism :
   One of the fundamental problems in tourism in Rajasthan is
   shortage of specialised advertisement and publicity of many significant
   attractions. Tourism information about tourism attractions, hotels, tourism
   facilities can promote tourism in Rajasthan, but due to lack of
   advertisement tourists are not informed about tourism attractions. 

2) Problems of shortage of accommodation :
   Different ranks of hotels and tourism facilities according to the
   financial abilities of tourists are a very important factor in tourism
   development. Due to lack of such facility a numbers of tourists have
   problems of availability of hotels at a cheaper rate and this causes many
   tourists to have a very short stay in Rajasthan.

3) Lack of Tourists reception centers (TRC)
   There is a lack of Tourists reception centers in Rajasthan which
   provide the basic information about the tourist destination in Rajasthan.
   The absence of this important centre, leads to loss in revenue, as tourists
   visiting Rajasthan do not move to all places of tourists attraction. 
   Nonavailability of the regional and continental dishes is also a big problem.

4) Lack of better communications facility
   In Rajasthan there are poor telecommunication infrastructures in
   terms of limited internet accessibility and difficulty of international calling.
   This often creates a sense of isolation amongst the tourist as they feel being
   deprived or cut off from their near and dear ones. It may at times lead to
   home sickness and force them to leave their tour without completing it. 

5) Every monument has separate tickets, which results in lots of
   haggling and wasting of time. Obsolete and non Interesting Tourism Itinerary that does not
   provide value for money, Inadequate updated tourist information is provided by the
   Department of Tourism and Rajasthan Tourism Development Corporation. 

6) Lack of innovativeness in marketing
   Rajasthan is one of the famous tourist destinations in the world but
   the tourism marketing is not so developed. There is no such promotional
   marketing activity about Rajasthan tourist attractions so that tourists can
   be attract towards Rajasthan. There is also no holding of cultural
   programmes in other state and countries of the world to make people
   aware about Rajasthan tourism. 

7) There is insufficient communication among the RTDC and travel
   agencies which creates problems in further planning. For example, the
   corporation may adjust their tour packages, tariff of hotels and luxurious
   trains according to the conditions every year, but some travel agencies
   haven't been informed, so they continuously sell the previous tourism
   products to the tourists. 

8) Despite being an alluring destination replete with forts, palaces, havelis, lakes and the sand dunes, tourism is on the decline in the state because of lack of concern and focus by the government. Even though the department has a budget of Rs 10 crore approximately for marketing, tourism in Rajasthan is not doing well.


Fact - In Rajasthan, tourism is the third largest employer after agriculture and textiles sector.
